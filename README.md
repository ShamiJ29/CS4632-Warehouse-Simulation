## Project Description
This project simulates warehouse operations including order processing,
inventory management, and robot-assisted picking and delivery.

The goal is to analyze order fulfillment time, robot utilization,
and storage efficiency under stochastic order arrivals.

## Features
Random order generation
Inventory tracking
Robot routing
Performance metrics collection
Discrete-event simulation model

## Technology
Language: Python (or Java/C++ – update later)
Simulation Type: Discrete-Event Simulation
